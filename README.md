# Predictive Models: Decision Tree in Regression and Classifier Comparison (Decision Trees, K-NN, Naive Bayes)

---

## Description

This project focuses on the implementation of predictive models. Initially, a decision tree regression model was developed to predict a company's profits based on variables such as research and development, administrative tasks, marketing and promotion expenses, general costs, and geographical location. The resulting model demonstrated exceptional capability with an adjusted R^2 of 0.99.

Subsequently, three different classification models were explored to predict Pokémon types based on their base statistics. The employed methods included decision trees, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN). Evaluation revealed superior performance by K-NN in classification. However, it is important to note that, despite this, the metrics obtained were suboptimal, leading to the conclusion that base statistics are not reliable predictors for Pokémon classification.
